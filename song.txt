How do I kill myself?
All the parts that have been created to please
And leave what's real, what still has meaning
I know it won't be enough for you
But it's out of my hands
I'm letting go

I'm so tired of
Not knowing who I'm supposed to be
I just want to find my way again
I'm so (used up) used up
From all that you ask from me
I just want to find myself again

How do I love myself?
With the constant reminder of all that I left behind
And it's all that you seem to want from me
I'm never enough for you
Well, it's out of my hands
I'm letting go
