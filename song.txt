How do I kill myself?
All the parts that have been created to please
And leave what's real, what still has meaning
I know it won't be enough for you
But it's out of my hands
I'm letting go

I'm so tired of
Not knowing who I'm supposed to be
I just want to find my way again
I'm so (used up) used up
From all that you ask from me
I just want to find myself again

How do I love myself?
With the constant reminder of all that I left behind
And it's all that you seem to want from me
I'm never enough for you
Well, it's out of my hands
I'm letting go

I'm so tired of
Not knowing who I'm supposed to be
I just want to find my way again
I'm so (used up) used up
From all that you ask from me
I just want to find myself again

What will it take?
How many times do I
Have to break
Before you get it?
I don't wanna be
What you remember
It's my sanity and happiness, it's not fucking about you

I'm so tired of
Not knowing who I'm supposed to be
I just want to find my way again

I'm so tired of
Not knowing who I'm supposed to be
I just want to find my way again
I'm so (used up) used up
From all that you ask from me
I just want to find myself again
